 # 🔍 WordPress Plugin Analyzer️

## 🌟 Overview

I want WordPress Plugin Analyzer to become a powerful tool designed to scan WordPress plugins for potential security vulnerabilities. It automatically downloads plugins, analyzes their PHP code, and reports possible security issues.

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Automatic plugin download and extraction
- 📊 Comparison of plugin versions for updates
- 🔬 In-depth code analysis using abstract syntax trees
- 🛡️ Multiple security checks for various vulnerability types

## 🔒 Security Checks

Our analyzer performs the following security checks:

1. 🗑️ Arbitrary File Deletion
2. 📖 Arbitrary File Read
3. 📤 Arbitrary File Upload
4. 🔓 Broken Access Control
5. 🔀 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
6. 📝 CSRF to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
7. 📁 Local File Inclusion (LFI)
8. 🔑 Missing Capability Checks
9. 🎭 PHP Object Injection
10. 🔋 Privilege Escalation
11. 💻 Remote Code Execution (RCE)
12. 💉 SQL Injection
13. 🌐 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Ensure you have Rust and its dependencies installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `cargo build --release` to compile the project.
4. Execute the binary with `cargo run --release`.

The analyzer will automatically:

- Fetch the latest WordPress plugins
- Compare with previous snapshots (if available)
- Download and analyze each plugin
- Report potential vulnerabilities

## 📊 Output

The analyzer provides detailed output for each potential vulnerability found, including:

- The file name
- The type of vulnerability
- Specific details about the detected issue

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes only. Always verify results manually and respect the WordPress plugin directory's terms of service.
